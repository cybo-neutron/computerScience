## **1. Single Responsibility Principle**
- A class should be having only one responsibility (or it should be doing one thing).
- It should have a single reason to change.

## **2. Open Closed Principle**
- Classes should be **open** for extension but **closed** to modification.
- We should be able to add new functionality without touching the existing code for the class.


## **3. Liskov Substitution Principle**
If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.
